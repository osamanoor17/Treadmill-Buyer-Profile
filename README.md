# EDA Portfolio Project - Treadmill Buyer Profile

## Project Overview
The market research team at **AeroFit** aims to identify key customer characteristics for each treadmill type offered by the company. By analyzing customer demographics and purchasing behavior, the team can improve recommendations for new buyers. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) will uncover insights into customer preferences and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Product Portfolio
AeroFit offers three treadmill models:
- **KP281**: Entry-level treadmill ($1,500)
- **KP481**: Mid-range treadmill for runners ($1,750)
- **KP781**: Advanced treadmill with premium features ($2,500)

## Dataset Information
The dataset (`aerofit_treadmill_data.csv`) contains the following features:
- **Product** - Purchased treadmill model: KP281, KP481, or KP781
- **Age** - Customer's age in years
- **Gender** - Male/Female
- **Education** - Years of education
- **MaritalStatus** - Single or partnered
- **Usage** - Expected weekly treadmill usage (times per week)
- **Fitness** - Self-rated fitness level (1-5, where 1 = poor, 5 = excellent)
- **Income** - Annual income in US dollars
- **Miles** - Expected weekly miles walked/ran
